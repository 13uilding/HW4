About==============================================================================

This application gives the user a 5 question quiz which tests html, css, and js knowledge. The application has a start button which triggers a 60 second timer. The timer counts down every second and everytime an incorrect answer is chosen (decreases time by 15s). Once the time is out, or all the questions have been answered, the user's score is displayed along with an input box. When the user enters a name and hits the enter key, their score is saved in local storage. If the user wants to see the high scores that are stored in local storage, the user can press the view high scores button to view the top 10 scores. If they want to run the quiz again, they can try to get a better score, and they can log their quiz results as many times as they want.

There are plenty of fixes and upgrades that I wanted to apply to this assignment, but I ran into many unforseen bugs and issues while coding. I didn't have time to fix these issues, and I feel bad for turning in a homework that I'm not totally pleased with.

Technologies=======================================================================
I programmed almost everything on the page. I used plenty of JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, flex-box, and a tiny bit of CSS. I borrowed some lines from this stack overflow question and MDN: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9907419/how-to-get-a-key-in-a-javascript-object-by-its-value 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort

I have included the functioning screenshot in the folder.
